    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package pasta</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>2 ½ tablespoons pesto</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
        Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring
        occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 to 10 minutes.
        Drain and transfer into a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add onion;
        cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in pesto, salt, and
        pepper until warmed through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add pesto mixture to hot pasta; stir in grated cheese and toss well to
        coat.
